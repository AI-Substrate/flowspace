```lation scripts for Flowspace.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING** ‚ö†Ô∏è
>
> **DO NOT USE WITH UNAPPROVED MODELS.** This tool provides LLMs with full access to entire codebases through its MCP server. Using Substrate/Flowspace with an unapproved model is equivalent to giving that model direct, unrestricted access to your codebase.
>
> **EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION** when using the MCP server with tools like Claude Code or any other LLM-powered coding assistants. Only use models that have been explicitly approved by your organization's security team for handling sensitive code.
>
> By design, Substrate grants comprehensive codebase access to enable powerful context-aware features. Ensure you understand and accept these security implications before use.

## What is Flowspace?

Flowspace (formerly Substrate) is your **Context Engineer** - an advanced semantic codebase analysis tool designed specifically for LLM coding agents. It performs deep semantic scans of entire codebases, creating comprehensive relationship graphs between all files, classes, methods, and concepts.

### Key Features

- **Semantic Code Understanding**: Creates detailed relationships between all code elements using AST parsing and SCIP analysis
- **Cross-Repository Intelligence**: Can analyze local repos or remote repositories, building a knowledge graph across your entire organization
- **Smart Content Generation**: Uses LLMs to generate intelligent summaries and embeddings for every code element
- **Vector Search**: Find code concepts semantically, like "automated testing for Microsoft Fabric" or "plugin for our Flutter app"
- **Context Engineering**: Provides LLM agents with immediate, comprehensive codebase knowledge for faster development
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with many programming languages through Tree-Sitter and specialized parsers
- **Fast Graph Storage**: Uses NetworkX for high-performance graph operations that scale to hundreds of thousands of nodes

Flowspace enables coding agents to instantly "know" your code, dramatically reducing the time needed to understand context and implement features across complex codebases.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, Windows (with WSL)
- **Architecture**: x86_64 (amd64), aarch64/arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Platform Support**:
